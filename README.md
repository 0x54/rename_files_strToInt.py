rename_files_strToInt.py
========================

It renames from 0 to N all the N files in the specified directory, sorting in natural order of the original files name. The output files are saved in the "orderedFiles" directory, created at the same path. The original files are not modified and all the permissions and metadata of renamed files are inalterated.
